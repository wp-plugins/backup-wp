While the internet has transformed the lives hundreds of millions of people around the world, made it easier for them to shop, seek information, meet friends, communicate and work, it is an unfortunate fact that the internet is also the playground of hackers. It is believed that tens of thousands of websites get hacked every day. Yes, a strong password is an effective barrier, but not effective enough.

Hackers these days are highly sophisticated and they are capable of finding their way around most of the firewalls built by you around your website data. So many owners of WordPress websites have complained about losing precious data to hacking, which often results in the crashing of their websites. The only way to remain secure is to create regular backup of your site, to ensure that when a problem arises, the site can be quickly restored and a semblance of normalcy is restored.

This is what the WordPress Backup plugin does  - it offers an effective solution that helps you deal with an emergency situation, find quick and easy answers to your problems and get your website up and running in no time at all.  When you use the WordPress Backup, you've effectively created an insurance for yourself against the worst that the most capable hackers of the world can do to you.

One of the biggest issues webmasters and website developers have is backing up the data present in the files and the database. This is because a typical website requires the creation of thousands of files and these files have to be saved at regular intervals of time. Often because of a hardware malfunction or a software crash, some or many of the files get lost - this would be about disastrous consequences for the website owners, besides laying to waste months and even years of hard work, this would effectively waste a fortune spent on the creation of the voluminous amount of data. Eventually, losing the precious data would sound the death knell for the website, over which so much blood, sweat and tears have been shed by the webmaster and his team of website developers. This is why you need to backup the website data.

The WordPress Backup plugin is unique and highly effective for backing up your WordPress website. Its simple user interface has an intuitive feel to it, making the whole backup process a child's play for you - which makes it so much better than the other backup plugins available in the market.
